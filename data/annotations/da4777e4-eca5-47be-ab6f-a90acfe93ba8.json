The essential question was asked yesterday and I believe it was asked by a student. How do we delineate the movements and currents in Latin American art? Speak out, charla bate-papo."

Any art critic always feels inadequate -that it is a little more difficult."

On the practical side, as señor Gamboa pointed out, there is much to be done. It seems to me that all the questions circulated around the problem of diffusion, which is not a problem of South America or North America, but a problem everywhere, and the mechanics of that diffusion, I believe that Mrs. Duncan is correct in saying that we must have a richer literature, more references. People should be able to find, to have access to coherent accounts of the past. We do have the means in such symposia of being a little sharper in how we would approach that."
