Any art critic always feels inadequate -that it is a little more difficult."

On the practical side, as se√±or Gamboa pointed out, there is much to be done. It seems to me that all the questions circulated around the problem of diffusion, which is not a problem of South America or North America, but a problem everywhere, and the mechanics of that diffusion, I believe that Mrs. Duncan is correct in saying that we must have a richer literature, more references. People should be able to find, to have access to coherent accounts of the past. We do have the means in such symposia of being a little sharper in how we would approach that."
