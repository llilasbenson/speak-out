I'm going to go by alphabetical order and I'm going to ask them to speak by alphabetical order. The first by alphabetical order is Juan Acha. Juan Acha's City, second person, with spectacles, to the left. He's Peruvian, Peruvian international. You know that sometimes the styles are called with names like that. Acha is a Peruvian international, as I am an Argentine, Franco, Americanized, Buenos Aires type of person. Acha is a distinguished critic. Yesterday I made the mistake of asking him about his B.T. But he didn't want me to tell anything. He exists, he's there, and we admire him. He teaches at the university in Mexico City where he lives and works now, and he's one of the distinguished collaborators of Plural."

The one that I had that you gave me in Caracas last year was stolen, so that means that is a very precious object. One of his last books is Dos Decadas Vulnerables del Arte de Latinoamerica.

I am referring to the question, to what we have been asked, whether there really is a Latin American art. There is definitely a Latin American art. I have been a person with a great interest in Latin America. I have even turned down exhibitions in Europe. It can be said that I have given in a disdainful, arrogant, pretentious way to the great Paris, I began to exhibit in 1955, with great success, a monograph written by Philippe Soupault and Jean Cassou. However, I broke my European contacts to devote my efforts to travel all over Latin America exhibiting. That is why I was able to get in touch with Latin American artists. With authentic Latin American artists. Later, when I was already in New York, exhibiting biennially in this art center, I was able to realize the rather pitiful attitude of Latin American artists living a painful exile in New York City, looking for an opportunity that New York galleries could give them."
