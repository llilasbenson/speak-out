By way of a defective summary, I would like to say the following about him: Oviedo has been literary critic of the Sunday supplement of El Comercio de Lima since 1959 and literary advisor to several publishing houses in his country and abroad. He has served as a member of distinguished commissions or juries in charge of judging certain literary contests. In addition to his journalism, he has been a regular contributor to the most prestigious magazines of the continent."

I hasten to add right away that this affection for Peruvian authors and themes does not imply in him any limitation or bell tower spirit. I would almost say the opposite. For example, his second book of 1964 is simply entitled César Vallejo. In another of the following year, he now deals with Ricardo Palma. To give you an idea of the variety of José Miguel Oviedo's extensive production, I would also like to mention the following."

He published two collections of Peruvian narrators in 1968, and in another book entitled Estos 13, 1973, he studied the new Peruvian poetry, presenting both documents and a selection of young poets. I believe that his conversations with Luis Alberto Sanchez were published in book form, also in the same year of '73. Oviedo has collaborated with valuable works in collective anthologies. He is a prolific writer of Palma, Velarde, Salazar Bondy, Vargas Llosa, Cardenal and others. Finally, as if this were not enough, I would like to draw attention to his work devoted to the study of contemporary novelists. To García Márquez and especially to his book on Vargas Llosa, entitled The Invention of a Reality, which appeared in 1970. Having said all this, what remains for me now is to thank him for his presence with us and to extend to him the warmest welcome to Austin."

This book, I note, also includes a work, if I am not mistaken, on the Colombian poet José Asunción Silva. Another book that enriches his biography on Drummont, appears in 72 and finally, without taking into account other minor works, it should be mentioned that Romano de Sant'Anna publishes his important Análise Estrutural De Romances Brasileiros, 1973. This title reveals the structuralist orientation of our friend's critical work. On behalf of all of us, I repeat, I extend to Romano de Sant'Anna, the most cordial welcome to the University of Texas and tell him that he is at home."

In my opinion, Tomás Segovia is fundamentally a poet, perhaps it would be better to say that he is a writer, period. He is also a writer of very varied and very different facets. As for his work as a lyric poet, his first book of verses, La luz provisional, dates from 1950. The last book of poems that I have of his is entitled Terceto, which was published towards the end of 1972. His publication in verse probably includes, according to the count that I make in the library files, more than half a dozen titles, and I do not think that I am exaggerating."

It is a historical work in terms of the time in which the action takes place. Mentioned this last book, it would be good to remember here that Tomás Segovia was Spanish. Born in Valencia. Tomás Segovia belongs to a distinguished group of Spaniards who, after the civil war, settled in Mexico, the country where Segovia arrived in 1940. According to Octavio Paz, Segovia's stay in Mexico marks his second birth. That is, when he was born into literature. In addition, Octavio Paz prophesies a third birth. What I want to say here and now is that I have treated him and admired him, I believe, during his second life. Poet, novelist and essayist. Segovia, in my opinion, more than anything else, is a lucid and at the same time passionate intelligence. Sharp, quick and accurate in the exposition of his themes. Of imaginative prose is also his last book, or the last one I know of, Trizadero, which was published last year. I would also like to mention here his work as a translator. He has translated Rimbaud, Ungarretti, André Breton, among other contemporary writers. About this writer by trade, of copious and multiple published works, I would like to add that he is currently affiliated with the Colegio de México, where he combines, as he has told me lately, his interests in linguistics, stylistics and translation."

It is, as we know nowadays, no one is surprised that a broad-ranging critic, such as Michel Foucault, begins by quoting Borges. The problem would be to see what happens the other way around, a writer who begins by quoting a critic. This can also happen, but it seems that, if in Latin America nobody is surprised anymore by a critic, even an international critic. I am not going to enter into the discussion of identity, I am referring only to geographical remoteness, a critic from far away is quoting a distant writer, that's all - However, it seems difficult for a distant writer to start quoting a Latin American critic, any book. What I mean by this is that there seems to be a bit of a gap, that the step forward that literary creation seems to have taken, has in a certain way moved ahead of the criticism that corresponds to it. Perhaps this has always been the case in Latin America. It would be necessary to make a historical review. Perhaps in Rubén Darío's time something similar could be said, that Rubén Darío, at least for those who knew about it, was already a planetary writer, while Latin American criticism was perhaps not planetary at that time. In any case, I believe that this must be taken into account when we discuss the problems of Latin American criticism."

That is, something that stands between the receiver and the sender. I have the impression that in this era--I don't know very well what I mean by this era, I don't know since when. Anyway. In this epoch, a very characteristic feature is, a kind of inversion in the order of the levels of language. I am not saying that it is a total and radical inversion, but there are some aspects in which this has been inverted, in which metalanguage comes before language. Already this morning in the art panel that was discussed a little bit, if criticism was going to give the models for art or if art was going to give the models for criticism."

Let us say that we could say that a language is itself a metalanguage of its own metalanguage."

I think there is an order and that starting with metalanguage is an inversion of this order and that this can influence in the sense that many of the problems we discuss when we talk about critique and creation are problems seen in reverse. That is to say, problems of derived things that we see in the first place."

Several factors have influenced these changes. To start with, I shall consider that today literary criticism in Brazil is strongly related to the university. Previously, literary criticism was in the domain of journalists, diplomats, and the so called man of letters, a category that includes some peculiar characters such as bohemians, people with literary manias, and literary curiosities. In other words, literary criticism in Brazil is no more an activity for amateurs. Even some schools and many teachers cannot follow the rhythm of change."

Another factor have also influenced Brazilian criticism, the advent of structuralism. When I say structuralism, I mean the discussion and arguments in relation to it. Being either for or against it, teachers and critics had to prepare themselves to face a new language and the philosophy which would propose a new vision of the world. The best Brazilian criticism today is aware of the changes and modifications in the concept of literature as well the concept of semiology."

The concept of literature is relative and essentially ideological. To put it crudely, let us say, it changes according to temperature and pressures. Probably, literature is not a word previously defined by God and his angels. In order to understand, literature as an ideological concept, we have to be prepared for some redefinitions. The first one, the concept of ideology itself."
