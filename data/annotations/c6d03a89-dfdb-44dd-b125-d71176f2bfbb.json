If Szyszlo agrees in certain senses with Marta and Cuevas, Carlos Rodriguez presents a more open attitude."

It seems to me that all the questions circulated around the problem of diffusion, which is not a problem of South America or North America, but a problem everywhere, and the mechanics of that diffusion, I believe that Mrs. Duncan is correct in saying that we must have a richer literature, more references. People should be able to find, to have access to coherent accounts of the past. We do have the means in such symposia of being a little sharper in how we would approach that."

Lo tomo más bien como un síntoma de que esas preguntas siguen vivas y de que las respuestas que damos aquí son insatisfactorias e inconclusas y, por lo tanto, vale la pena continuar."

En el aspecto práctico, como señaló el señor Gamboa, queda mucho por hacer. Me parece que todas las cuestiones que circulan en torno al problema de la difusión, que no es un problema de América del Sur o de América del Norte, sino un problema en todas partes, y la mecánica de esa difusión, creo que la señora Duncan tiene razón al decir que debemos tener una literatura más rica, más referencias. La gente debe poder encontrar, tener acceso a relatos coherentes del pasado. En este tipo de simposios tenemos los medios para ser un poco más agudos en la forma de enfocar esto."
