The best introduction to Alejandro Otero is for people to go see the exhibition currently on display here at the University of Austin. However, I might add that, like all artists, he has his soft spot, his vanity—just as I have mine, and he was bitterly complaining to me that the reproductions of his works published in Plural were not well done. Of course, I apologized, although I'm not the machine that prints."}]}],"tags":[{"category":"Speakers","tag":"Sakai, Kazuya, 1927-2001 (man)"},{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Otero, Alejandro"},{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"University of Texas at Austin"},{"category":"Organizations","tag":"Plural"},{"category":"Subjects Headings","tag":"Art, Latin American"},{"category":"Subjects Headings","tag":"Art and society"},{"category":"Subjects Headings","tag":"Multiculturalism"}],"uuid":"7184fa63-afc5-4669-8b48-ea9d1146841b"},{"start_time":1209,"end_time":1237,"annotation":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Maybe it's Damián Bayón's fault, because he sent a very good text, but very bad photographs.
