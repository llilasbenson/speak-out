Once again, we’re talking about identity. It’s a major concern of ours, and I believe there’s good reason for that concern—especially when it comes to defining what it means to be Latin American. I very much fear that in trying to define this, we’re going to create an abnormal subject—we’re going to create a two-headed phenomenon. And this is why. I must say that if this discussion had taken place during the time of the Spanish conquest, this wouldn’t be an issue. But we’re speaking about the present moment, and that’s where the problem lies. There are countries in Latin America—Mexico in particular—where the Indigenous root is fundamental today. We Mexicans are proud of our Indigenous blood. We are mestizos. Our friends in South America are proud to be criollos—and to be criollo is to be a foreigner born in the country, or a descendant of foreigners born in the country. It is very difficult to define what it means to be Latin American in view of this. That’s why I say we would have to create a two-headed being: one criollo head and one mestizo head."}]}],"tags":[{"category":"Speakers","tag":"Tamayo, Rufino, 1899-1991 (man)"},{"category":"Places","tag":"Mexico"},{"category":"Subjects Headings","tag":"Art criticism"},{"category":"Subjects Headings","tag":"Historians"},{"category":"Subjects Headings","tag":"Art, Latin American"}],"uuid":"7ca39187-9576-4be9-a779-44943b17e583"},{"start_time":1262,"end_time":1343,"annotation":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Notice that when we talk here about imported models, there is a strong emphasis on that, especially from our South American friends.

We mestizos would have more right to speak about that. So, I would like, on another occasion—because this would take a lot of time—for us to talk about that and get to the essence of the problem.

As I understand it, in the program, it refers to criticism as seen by the artist.

We are moved that there are people who try to analyze what we do. We’re sometimes amazed that what we create becomes the subject of a literary piece.
