Tomás Segovia belongs to a distinguished group of Spaniards who, after the civil war, settled in Mexico, the country where Segovia arrived in 1940.

What I want to say here and now is that I have treated him and admired him, I believe, during his second life. Poet, novelist and essayist. Segovia, in my opinion, more than anything else, is a lucid and at the same time passionate intelligence. Sharp, quick and accurate in the exposition of his themes. Of imaginative prose is also his last book, or the last one I know of, Trizadero, which was published last year. I would also like to mention here his work as a translator. He has translated Rimbaud, Ungarretti, André Breton, among other contemporary writers.

There is a new generation of critics and there is a new approach to literary studies. Several factors have influenced these changes. To start with, I shall consider that today literary criticism in Brazil is strongly related to the university. Previously, literary criticism was in the domain of journalists, diplomats, and the so called man of letters, a category that includes some peculiar characters such as bohemians, people with literary manias, and literary curiosities. In other words, literary criticism in Brazil is no more an activity for amateurs. Even some schools and many teachers cannot follow the rhythm of change."}]}],"tags":[{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Sant'Anna, Affonso Romano de (man)"},{"category":"Subjects Headings","tag":"Latin American literature"},{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Literary criticism"}],"uuid":"daabb3c7-63c7-4114-a41d-7b5aa7279071"},{"start_time":1588,"end_time":1647,"annotation":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"If we interpret the history of literature also as a struggle for power, I would say that today, literary power is held by the university.

Being either for or against it, teachers and critics had to prepare themselves to face a new language and the philosophy which would propose a new vision of the world.
