Years ago, a famous North American critic is set to a remark that he had read Latin American literature and found that it was only of anthropological interest. Clearly an apocryphal story. If it isn't, it ought to be. I wonder if we can say the same thing of Latin American criticism today. Dore Ashton quoted Borges' important essay The Argentine writer and tradition, which itself is a manifesto of the universal interest of Latin American literature."}]}],"tags":[{"category":"Speakers","tag":"Christ, Ronald J.

As an editor of review in English devoted to Latin American art, I read many essays from acknolowged, respected, and even brilliant Latin American critics. Many of them we have to reject, because when they are translated into English we find that the substance has almost completely evaporated. That might suggest a very easy solution. It might suggest that one criticism is good and right and one is wrong and bad. Clearly, that is not the answer. It is quite too simple."}]}],"tags":[{"category":"Speakers","tag":"Christ, Ronald J.

What is the appropriate medium of criticism? When a literary critic writes, his medium is identical to his subject matter; language. This is not true, for example, with art critics. Is it for this reason of a common medium put to a common, expressive purpose that to an outsider's eyes, the greatest critics of Latin American literature are also the practitioners of that literature?"}]}],"tags":[{"category":"Speakers","tag":"Christ, Ronald J.
