Very recently, he has won the grand prize of honor at the São Paulo Biennial. I believe we can warmly congratulate him on this great award, although, like Aracy Amaral, I personally do not agree with the policies of the biennials. However, of course, I must also clarify that I have submitted work to the Biennial many years ago, but I have since changed my mind."

I hope it doesn’t compute me too much or this table too much either, but he is indeed a remarkable artist who has tried or is trying to combine the problem of art and science, which qualifies him very well for the topic of this panel."

He easily receives, sometimes with more, and sometimes with less resistance, the information that surrounds him from the outside. These are the formative sources of the artist in our continent: the international ones, the indigenist movements, and others that shape him with an artistic personality."

Because if in the 19th century we were importers of manufactured goods from England, but from France we imported the model for cultural behavior, alongside a Creole behavior, we can say that today there is already a Latin American behavior in terms of conduct, but as a cultural expression we continue importing models. Insecure, therefore, about our popular roots. I think I will stop here."
