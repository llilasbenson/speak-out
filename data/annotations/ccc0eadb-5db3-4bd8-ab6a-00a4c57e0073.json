In one of his best critical essays, in my opinion, we see how he refers to Sarmiento's book Facundo. His vision is not to isolate Facundo as an autonomous text, but rather to link the work to its national context, to the vision of the Pampas, to geography. In other words, with values that clearly relate the literary work to the context from which it emerges."}]}],"tags":[{"category":"Speakers","tag":"Concha, Jaime, 1939- (man)"},{"category":"People","tag":"Rodó, José Enrique, 1871-1917"},{"category":"People","tag":"Sarmiento, Domingo Faustino, 1811-1888"},{"category":"Subjects Headings","tag":"Latin American literature"}],"uuid":"bbef8b85-4dc5-4e47-957b-ba36c9d28e26"},{"start_time":1169,"end_time":1210,"annotation":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"It would never have occurred to literary critics in the 19th century or at the beginning of the 20th century to separate the work in a sense of autonomy, as is currently practiced in universities.
