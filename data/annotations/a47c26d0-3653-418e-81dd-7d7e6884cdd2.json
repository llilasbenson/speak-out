It’s not just about the imposition of schemes or archetypes from Jung or theories from Northrop Frye—it’s simply an approach to the imagination, to Borges’ imaginary structures, just as they can be accessed today and in the most capable way. As for some of the paradoxes I’m experiencing myself—and possibly some other students are too—it’s that we’re told about structure as an autonomous entity that has various meanings. And now we’re being told it is entirely signifying, indicative, something that guides us."}]}],"tags":[{"category":"Speakers","tag":"Alazraki, Jaime (man)"},{"category":"People","tag":"Borges, Jorge Luis, 1899-1986"},{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Wheelock, Carter"},{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Jung, C.
