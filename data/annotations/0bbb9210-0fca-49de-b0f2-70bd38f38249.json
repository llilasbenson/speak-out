Art criticism in words is always secondary, which is not to say is irrelevant. Researches at the University of Rochester has discovered that the brain has what they call infinite capacity to start visual images. The start is in the unconscious mind. One of the retrieval mechanisms is words, which brings images to the conscious minds. Señor Gamboa speaks of Fernando Szyszlo's lyrical abstractions he gives us a mechanism for image retrieval. A culture is based on words, as the Arabs had 3000 words for camel equipment and as we have thousands for automobiles, what has no name disappears from culture. Written criticism may concern itself with social problems or anything else, but inasmuch as it is art criticism, its role is to be the sense of touch. That is to say, descriptive for the consciousness. Art history is useful because it liberates us from the tyranny of the momentary."}]}],"tags":[{"category":"Speakers","tag":"Speaker 1 (man)"},{"category":"People","tag":"Otero, Alejandro, 1921-1990"},{"category":"People","tag":"Mondrian, Piet, 1872-1944"},{"category":"People","tag":"Szyszlo, Fernando de, 1925-2017"},{"category":"People","tag":"Gamboa, Fernando, 1909-1990"},{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"University of Rochester"},{"category":"Subjects Headings","tag":"Art, Latin American"},{"category":"Subjects Headings","tag":"Art and society"},{"category":"Subjects Headings","tag":"Art criticism"},{"category":"Subjects Headings","tag":"Art and philosophy"},{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Lyrical abstraction"}],"uuid":"c0c8d8b9-d9f9-447c-96ec-ad2214a9e66a"},{"start_time":1236,"end_time":1272,"annotation":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"We all forget that it was Siqueiros in his manifesto of 1921 who defined the program of 20th century art, a program whose goals still lie before us and that it was Siqueiros and his experimental workshop in New York who invented the means by which Jackson Pollock made his contribution.

Because the artist tends to gather in groups — and in that kind of ghettoized separation that occurs abroad, there’s also a preservation of native traditions.
