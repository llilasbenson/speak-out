As one scratches the surface of the characteristics of this Latin American unit, it becomes more difficult to find. We feel very different from each other, without reaching the extremes that were presented this morning as sarcasm. In any case, there is no doubt that our differences are immense. However, since before Bolívar, for more than a century and a half, two centuries, we have been building the idea, the invention of a Latin America. This tenacity in inventing Latin America, it seems to me, has managed to create unity out of disparity. It is now a reality, by dint of wanting so much to be one."

Let's be clear, not from a folkloric and circumstantial continent, neo-Mayan, neo-Aztec, neo-Inca, no, better than that. They are from America in the sense of America as a future projection and not as a past projection, that which so worries and upsets indigenists of all stripes. What we are going to be, and not merely what we were, yes, what we are going to be within the same exorbitant impulse that saw us born on the second day of creation, as Keyserling said, when we dawned with innocence on Western history.\""

I come to learn from others. I welcome hearing about their varying political positions, their different experiences, their different personalities, and therefore I am a little astounded that only one remark out of all I said would be the thing that would stick in everybody's mind. What I really mean when I say multinational is just like one would say international. I'm neither an economist nor a politician. I am simply interested in cultural exchange as a means of communication among people, and I think each country works out its own economic reality. That was all I was trying to say."

In 1947, César Moro referred in Las Moradas magazine to an article written by an American poet on Peruvian literature. Commenting on the American poet's text, César said that, according to the poet, Europe was the past, America and the United States were the present, and Latin America was, why not, the future. César ended by quoting a Peruvian proverb, or perhaps a Spanish one in general, which says, “If you leave it there, you want me to forgive you.”"

That commentator said that, in contrast to Mexican muralism, which had dreamed that the people would go to see the murals, something that in reality does not always happen, since they are located in very specific buildings, the idea of multiplying street advertisements, flyers, which are stuck on walls and corners, or which cover entire 20-story buildings, with images of Martí or Che Guevara or Camilo Cienfuegos, are, for those coming from outside a city empty of commercial advertising, an absolutely indispensable element, urbanistically speaking, for mobilizing those enormous dead surfaces in our cities."

There was a moment of uncertainty, a temptation toward socialist realism just after the triumph of the revolution. They recovered and gave artists complete freedom. But the most interesting art in Cuba for me, without a doubt, is that of posters, advertisements, and billboards. These are produced in different centers that are naturally run by the centralized government, but which have such psychological finesse that the most difficult advertisements, so to speak, refer mainly to books and films that are being released. On the other hand, there is a more basic level of visual and signage or semantic understanding, as they say now, which is aimed at practical notices such as blood donation, childcare, literacy, and the major problems of the Cuban revolution. So, if I may answer with this, it seems to me that an artistic revolution is taking place there in an attempt to educate the people, which does not consist simply of painting or reproducing revolutionary themes, but of assimilating the entire level of contemporary art, including kinetic art and geometric forms. As I said yesterday, Le Parc's exhibition was a resounding success in Cuba, absolutely sensational, and by assimilating it in this way, transforming it into a work that may ultimately end up educating people artistically, which is what we all dream of."

This new, much broader, much larger audience was achieved, as Damián says, through the cleansing of all these visual elements, which in our societies are generally perverse, aren't they? In Cuba, on the other hand, they had an educational effect."

Sin embargo, creo que debemos aceptar la idea de que no todas las situaciones socialistas son iguales. Por ejemplo, en Checoslovaquia y Polonia, que he visitado, aunque nunca he estado en Cuba. Existe el mismo interés por el cine y el arte del cartel y por utilizar las artes visuales en aras de lo que tú llamas un proyecto educativo, pero también existe una comunidad disidente e infeliz de artistas y escritores. Personas que simpatizan totalmente con la palabra socialista y que, sin embargo, no pueden someterse al uso utilitario marxista del arte. Esas tragedias, esas tragedias personales de esos artistas, me parecen que se dirigen hacia algo transpersonal y tenemos que hacer una distinción. Si en Cuba es mejor y diferente, es muy importante decir por qué y cómo."

That is, it is about the appropriation of a cultural experience, specifically Latin American. This is demonstrated in the work, but how is this appropriation specifically demonstrated? For example, I think that if we were to refer to, say, the treatment of the mythical or the playful in literature today, I think we could more specifically specify what is actually Latin American in contemporary works. I would like to put this question to one of the panelists to see if they have anything to say."

That alone, in itself, alters realism so profoundly, either because they are methods that go backwards, to Lazarillo de Tormes, to Quevedo's Buscón, or methods that project themselves to the same avant-garde era in which Icaza is writing, so that his formula in Huasipungo, more grotesque realism, or whatever it may be, is a new formula that is not found in the same way in other parts of Europe."

Then, of course, there was Carrasquilla and other writers. In short, if we put Huasipungo on one side and No One Writes to the Colonel on the other, we would have a very clear process of transformation of models, someone spoke of models. European models that had been partly acclimatized by previous generations and partly reacclimatized in Latin America."

[laughter] So, how can we find what is specifically Latin American?"

By becoming familiar with Latin American literature, one is closer to understanding the specifics, but also the question itself is no longer Latin American. I'm going to address what I believe is the underlying theme of this conference. If we are so concerned about whether or not we are Latin American, we are already framing the question incorrectly. Of course we are Latin American, what are we going to do? Do we look Australian? Are we speaking one of the Eastern languages? We are fatally Latin American."
