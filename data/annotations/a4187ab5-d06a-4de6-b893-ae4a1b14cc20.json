We are discussing here things of 30 years ago, since I am absolutely persuaded, to give a short list, that since ancient times, what Torres García achieved, the Brazilian architecture of the 1940s, the work of Tamayo and Matta, the work of the Venezuelan and Argentinean kineticists, is perfectly original anywhere in the world. It didn't exist before."

A person as civilized, apparently, as Julio Cortázar is a cultural mestizo. Severo Sarduy, the Cuban from Paris, is a cultural mestizo too. I say that without any pejorative sense. In English he may have it, in Spanish he does not. Why? Precisely, because in the case of Sarduy, for example, he arrives very young in Paris, practically half-formed, just beginning to transform."
