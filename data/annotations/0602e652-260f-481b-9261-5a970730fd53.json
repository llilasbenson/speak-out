It is a mixture of history, sociological analysis, and social criticism. The same phenomenon occurred with other lesser-known writers, but the name that immediately stands out is Monteiro Lobato. He created the image of the exploited and suffering country man, El Jeca Tatu."

The problem of cultural assimilation and the affirmation of a distinct culture had, in a way, already been resolved in the previous decade.

What is language as a social instrument and as a social production? What is the totalizing language of the state and the mass media? The question that the writer asks himself, “Who speaks in me when I speak? Is it projected onto language without answer?”"

It seems to me that if we are literary critics, it is quite difficult to become a literary critic, so that we also try to be philosophical, sociological, epistemological critics, and so on. If we are literary critics, we must begin by examining the message that every work contains at the level of its own structure."

He has written a huge number of books, as we all know, intended for that purpose, as he says, “Propaganda in literature.” That function exists and is undoubtedly present. For many, it is a vital function. I believe that Latin American artists do not want to remain in that role. Neruda himself did not want to remain in that role. Throughout his social work, he speaks of militant, combative poetry, but he also speaks of what he calls “the wave of mysteries” or, in his posthumous poetry, “the well of being.” It is strange that such a militant poet should nevertheless enter into the eternal questions of poetry. We also know that Neruda learned to write in the European tradition of 19th- and 20th-century poetry."
