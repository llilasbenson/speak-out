That was the word used by a distinguished visitor, and she was right. Judging from the outside, I see that we always limp on the same foot. I propose something very concrete, and I feel like asking the members of the panel—Juan Acha, Carlos—what they think of the case. It’s the case of Julio Le Parc, in my opinion the most imaginative of the Argentine kinetic artists in Paris, who, between 1958 and 1968, with his group Recherche d’Art Visuel, carried out a series of truly extraordinary experiments, full of imagination and visual interest."}]}],"tags":[{"category":"Speakers","tag":"Bayón, Damián (man)"},{"category":"People","tag":"Acha, Juan, 1916-1995"},{"category":"People","tag":"Rodríguez Saavedra, Carlos"},{"category":"People","tag":"Le Parc, Julio, 1928-"},{"category":"Places","tag":"France--Paris"},{"category":"Subjects Headings","tag":"Art criticism"},{"category":"Subjects Headings","tag":"Art and society"},{"category":"Subjects Headings","tag":"Art, Latin American"},{"category":"Art Topics","tag":"Kinetic art"},{"category":"Art Topics","tag":"Groupe de Recherche d'Art Visuel"}],"uuid":"dbc7de86-610b-4e2b-8a1d-7438a73ede01"},{"start_time":1136,"end_time":1164,"annotation":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Already in 1966, at the Venice Biennale, where he surprisingly won the painting prize—because they didn’t know which prize to give him, but clearly wanted to give him one—I remember being puzzled, because some of the elements resembled a carnival, but there were still those striped glasses and a bunch of things that strained the eyes and transformed reality in a very interesting way."}]}],"tags":[{"category":"Speakers","tag":"Bayón, Damián (man)"},{"category":"Subjects Headings","tag":"Art criticism"},{"category":"Subjects Headings","tag":"Art and society"},{"category":"Subjects Headings","tag":"Art, Latin American"},{"category":"Art Topics","tag":"Venice Biennale"}],"uuid":"b94fa702-a43c-4e91-b046-be98e1fd7598"},{"start_time":1164,"end_time":1201,"annotation":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Then comes May ’68, and Julio Le Parc gets excited about the student revolution, the revolt.
